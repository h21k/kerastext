      "Study design: A retrospective review of prospectively collected data in an academic institution. Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new type of titanium mesh cage (TMC) in single-level, anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF). Methods: Fifty-eight patients consecutive with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) from cervical degenerative spondylosis and isolated ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament were treated with a single-level ACCF using either a new type of TMC (28 patients, group A) or the traditional TMC (30 patients, group B). We evaluated the patients for TMC subsidence, cervical lordosis (C2-C7 Cobb and Cobb of fused segments) and fusion status for a minimum of 30 months postoperatively based on spine radiographs. In addition, neurologic outcomes were evaluated using the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) scores. Neck pain was evaluated using a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS). Results: The loss of height of the fused segments was less for group A than for group B (0.8 + 0.3 vs. 2.8 + 0.4 mm) (p < 0.01); also, there was a lower rate of severe subsidence (>3 mm) in group A (4 %, 1/28) than in group B (17 %, 5/30) (p < 0.01). There were no differences in the C2-C7 Cobb and Cobb of fused segments between the groups preoperatively or at final follow-up (p > 0.05), but the Cobb of fused segments immediately postoperative were significantly less for group B than for group A (p < 0.01). All patients, however, had successful fusion (100 %, each). Both groups had marked improvement in the JOA score after operation (p < 0.01), with no significant differences in the JOA recovery ratio (p > 0.05). The postoperative VAS neck pain scores for group A were significantly less than that for group B (p < 0.05); severe subsidence was correlated with neck pain. Conclusions: The new type of TMC provides comparable clinical results and fusion rates with the traditional TMC for patients undergoing single-level corpectomy. The new design TMC decreases postoperative subsidence (compared to the traditional TMC); the unique design of the new type of TMC matches the vertebral endplate morphology which appears to decrease the severity of subsidence-related neck pain in follow-up.  2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\n",
